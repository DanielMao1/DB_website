    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Database research group of Southern University of Science and Technology（ DBGroup@SUSTech ）founded in 2017, it belongs to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Southern University of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>At present, the team has developed more than 30 members, including one assistant professor, two research assistant professors, seven doctoral students and visiting doctoral students, one visiting scholar, master&rsquo;s degree students and undergraduates.</p>
<p>The main research directions of the team include big data analysis system, large-scale information retrieval, information visualization and computer vision.</p>
<p>The research achievement of DBgroup have been published in top database conferences and journals (SIGMOD, PVLDB, TKDE, etc.). The main research objectives of dbgroup are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to improve the existing algorithms to achieve order of magnitude performance improvement;</li>
<li>to build a new system to achieve a breakthrough from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent three years, the research achievements of undergraduate students of the research group have been published in several CCF-A conferences, such as PVLDB, ICDE, SIGIR, etc. The undergraduate students of the research group rank among the top 5 in the world in the 2020 SIGMOD programming contest. The undergraduates of the research group have been awarded the Top Ten Graduates of Southern University of Science and Technology for two consecutive years.</p>
<p>Among them, Tang Bo is the team leader. He received a doctor&rsquo;s degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2017. In the same year, he joined the database group of Southern University of Science and Technology (DBGroup), and is currently an assistant professor (doctoral supervisor) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Institute of technology.</p>
<p>His research directions include big data management and analysis system, query optimization technology, business intelligence, etc.</p>
<p>He has been a visiting researcher at the National Institute of Mathematics and Computer (CWI, Amsterdam) and Microsoft Research Asia (MsrA, Beijing).</p>
<p>In addition, Tang Bo also served as the coach of the Southern University of Science and Technology programming competition team, leading the Southern University of Science and Technology programming competition team. Up to now, the team has won 58 Asian, national, provincial gold, silver and bronze medals, covering 6 major colleges. 174 person-times.</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Xiao is a research assistant professor in the Computer Department of Southern University of Science and Technology.
The main research direction is database and machine learning, especially data mining, large-scale data indexing and retrieval, random algorithms, and efficient machine learning algorithms and systems. Dr. Xiao Yan graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and has published more than ten papers at top international conferences such as SGIMOD, VLDB, NeurIPS, ATC, etc. Dr. Xiao Yan is currently a reviewer for well-known international academic conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI, and top academic journals such as IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, and VLDBJ.</p>
<p>Dr. Zeng Dan is a research assistant professor in the Computer Department of Southern University of Science and Technology.
The main research directions are biometric recognition, face recognition and three-dimensional face modeling, computer vision and deep learning. Dr. Zeng Dan graduated from Sichuan University in 2018, and then engaged in post-doctoral research in the DMB laboratory of the University of Twente in the Netherlands. She has published more than ten papers in top international journals and conferences such as IEEE TPAMI, IVC, CVPR, ECCV, etc. He currently serves as IEEE TIFS , PR, PRL, IVC, AAAI and other top international journals and well-known academic conference reviewers.</p>
<p>The team has continuous cooperative relationships with research institutions such as the National University of Singapore, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has joint research projects with leading companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Bytedance, and Huawei.
The R&amp;D technology is applied to Microsoft Power BI products, the open-source columnar storage database MonetDB system, Alibaba&rsquo;s online recommendation system and Huawei&rsquo;s MindSpore deep learning system. The sources of longitudinal research funding for the research group include the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, the Special Scientific Research Project of the New Coronary Pneumonia Epidemic Prevention and Control of the Education Department of Guangdong Province and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission.
