      <description>Large-scale Similarity Search Similarity search is the task that finds the items that are most similar to a query in a large collection of items. Similarity search is a common task in data science with many applications including recommendation, image search, document retrieval and entity resolution. Many famous companies are devoted to researches on similarity search, e.g., Google, Microsoft and Facebook. However, efficient similarity search is challenging due to large dataset cardinality (e.</description>

      <description>Efficient and effective data visualization Spatial-temporal visualization techniques have been applied in various real-world applications and assist the data exploration by leveraging the sharp perception of human analysts. However, large data visualization is challenging. 1) The long data to visualization latency (query time, computing time and rendering time) always break the continuity of the human involved data exploration loop; 2) visual clutter caused by a large amount of data hinders the ability of the human to discover the insight.</description>

      <description>In this course, using fundamental concepts of probability theory, we present an introduction to the design of adaptive information processing systems. This course extends coursework on adaptive signal processing and can also be taken as an introduction to **machine learning** and **data science**. Typical application areas include pattern recognition, medical signal analysis, speech and language processing, image processing, bio-informatics and robotics. In the 2018/19 academic year, this class is taught in semester B (3rd quarter) and starts on 4-Feb-2019.</description>

      <guid>https://danielmao1.github.io/teaching/bmlip-2019/</guid>
      <description>This course covers the fundamentals of a Bayesian (i.e., probabilistic) approach to machine learning and information processing systems. The Bayesian approach allows for a unified and consistent treatment of many model-based machine learning techniques. We focus on Linear Gaussian systems and will discuss many useful models and applications, including common regression and classification methods, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models and Kalman filters. We will discuss important algorithms for parameter estimation in these models including the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Variational Bayes (VB).</description>
