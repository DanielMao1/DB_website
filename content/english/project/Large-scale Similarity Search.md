## Large-scale Similarity Search
Similarity search is the task that finds the items that are most similar to a query in a large collection of items. Similarity search is a common task in data science with many applications including recommendation, image search, document retrieval and entity resolution. Many famous companies are devoted to researches on similarity search, e.g., Google, Microsoft and Facebook. However, efficient similarity search is challenging due to large dataset cardinality (e.g., with billions of high-dimensional vectors) and stringent latency and quality requirements (recall>0.9 within 10ms). Under this topic, we will explore the following directions:
 -  Search algorithms for different similarity measures, e.g., Euclidean distance, inner product, edit distance and earth mover distance; 
 -  Efficient similarity search with modern hardware, including GPU, SSD and NVM; 
 -  Large-scale distributed similarity search on many machines; 
 -  Using machine learning techniques to improve similarity search.
