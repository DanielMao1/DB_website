## Efficient and effective data visualization

Spatial-temporal visualization techniques have been applied in various real-world applications and assist the data exploration by leveraging the sharp perception of human analysts. However, large data visualization is challenging. 1) The long data to visualization latency (query time, computing time and rendering time) always break the continuity of the human involved data exploration loop; 2) visual clutter caused by a large amount of data hinders the ability of the human to discover the insight. We aim to solve this problem by combing multiple techniques including quality-guaranteed data reduction, approximate query and task-adopt data materialization.

## Visualization for HPC system
High-performance computing(HPC) system has been developed for the large data storage, query and analysis. A unified visual analytics platform for these systems is helpful for system users to observe, understand and diagnose the system running process.  We aim to develop the corresponding visualization toolkits to be embedded into the current open-source HPC systems, empower the users to better perform the large data exploration.
