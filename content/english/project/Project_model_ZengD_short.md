## Reserach Project I - 2D Face recognition and 3D Face Modeling
Face recognition accuracy has already exceeded the human eye recognition on some public face databases. However, under the public security oriented surveillance environment, the captured face images suffer from many challengs such as pose variation, low resolution, illumination variation and uncontrolled expressions. The changes due to these challenges maybe large than that caused by different identities, which makes the performance of face recognition decrease tremendously.

3D face reconstuction, which refers to the process of estimating the 3D face geometry from a single 2D image, is a widely explored computer vision task. It enjoys a wide range of real-world applications, such as assisting pose or expression invariant face recognition, facial animation, and facial expression analysis. In general, it is inherently ill-posed as there are always multiple 3D faces can project the same 2D face images onto the 2D plane.

I have been working on this research topic during my Ph.D., and the research output about tackling this problem can be seen in my CV.

## Reserach Project II - Face Super Resolution (Face Hallucination)
Face super-resolution (SR), which refers to the process of recovering high-resolution (HR) face images from the low resolution (LR) ones, is an
important class of image processing techniques in computer vision. It enjoys a wide range of real-world applications, such as portal control, 
video surveillance and traffic monitoring. In general, this problem is very challenging and inherently ill-posed since there are always multiple
HR images that explain the LR input equally well. 

To tackle the SR problem, we have two submissions. One paper entitled "Face Super-Resolution with Highway for High Frequency Signal" is submitted to CVPR2021. The other paper entitled "Progressive Face Super-Resolution with Shape and Identity Priors" is submitted to IJCAI2021.

## Reserach Project III - Retina recognition
The retinal vasculature is rich in structure and is supposed to be distinctive for each individual and each eye. It is claimed to be the most secure biometric since it is not easy to change or replicate the retinal vasculature. Retina recognition aims to recognize the identity of a person by using 
retina biometric. In general, the image acquisition involves cooperation of the subject, entails contact with the eyepiece, and requires a conscious effort on the part of the
user. All these factors adversely affect the public acceptability of the retina biometric. 

This research project is an on-going research at the priliminary stage.

## Reserach Project IV - Expression Recognition with Applications to Stock Market Prediction
Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness, etc.
By exploring the CEO's expressions changes in their public speech on stock listings, it is possible for us to make prediction about trends (rise or fall) of stocks. 
This project is a collaborative work between Fiance department and Computer Science and Engineering department.

This research project is an on-going research.
