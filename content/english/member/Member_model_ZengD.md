Dan Zeng received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and technology from Sichuan University in 2013 and 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Zhisheng You and Prof. Qijun Zhao. Since 2012, she participated in ‘3+2+3’ Joined Study of Bachelor and Doctoral Degree program of Sichuan University (Top 5%). She worked as a post-doc research fellow in the Data Management and Biometrics (DMB) Lab at the University of Twente, the Netherlands from 2018 to 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Raymond Veldhuis. Her major research interests include Biometrics, Medical Biometrics, and Computer vision. Her recent research interests lie in face super-resolution, face recognition and 3D face modeling, Retina recognition, expression recognition with applications to finance and intelligent pain scale with applications to delivery labor. She is a member of the IEEE.
