abstract = "Recently, the spatial-temporal data of urban moving objects, e.g., cars and buses, are collected and widely used in urban trajectoryexploratory analysis. Urban bus service is one of the most common public transportation services. Urban bus data analysis playsan important role in smart city applications. For example, data analysts in bus companies use the urban bus data to optimize their busscheduling plan. Map services providers, e.g., Google map, Tencent map, take urban bus data into account to improve their servicequality (e.g., broadcast road update instantly). Unlike urban moving cars or pedestrians, urban buses travel on known bus routes.The operating buses form the “bus flows” in a city. Efficient analyzing urban bus flows has many challenges, e.g., how to analyzethe dynamics of given bus routes? How to help users to identifytraffic flow of interests easily?In this work, we present CheetahVIS, a visual analytical systemfor efficient massive urban bus data analysis. CheetahVIS buildsupon Spark and provides a visual analytical platform for the stakeholders (e.g., city planner, data analysts in bus company) to conducteffective and efficient analytical tasks. In the demonstration, demovisitors will be invited to experience our proposed CheetahVISsystem with different urban bus data analytical functions, e.g., busroute analysis, public bus flow overview, multiple region analysis,in a real-world dataset. We also will present a case study, whichcompares different regions in a city, to demonstrate the effectiveness of CheetahVIS"
